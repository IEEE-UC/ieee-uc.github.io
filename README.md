## Editable Content

This project includes a folder named `editable-content` located in the `src` directory. This folder is designed to make the site easily customizable by nontechnical users. For example, the `officers` subfolder contains a `officers.json` file where you can define the details of officers, such as their name, role, image, quote, and description. These details are dynamically loaded into the site.
